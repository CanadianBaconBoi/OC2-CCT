### What?
This is a mod that adds a single block, the "Universal Interface". It exports the ComputerCraft peripheral API to OpenComputers2 and exports the OpenComputers2 networking API to ComputerCraft.

### How?
The "Universal Interface" functions as a bridge between the OpenComputers and ComputerCraft networking APIs. By doing so it allows inter-communication via the OpenComputers2 device bus and ComputerCraft's networking/modems.

### Why?
This project is just intended to tide me and others over for the time being until peripheral support gets better for OpenComputers2.
