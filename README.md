# OC2-CC:T <br> <sup>[OpenComputers2](https://github.com/fnuecke/oc2) and [ComputerCraft](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) working together</sup>

### What?
This is a mod that adds a single block, the "Universal Interface". It exports similar functions to both mods in order to allow communication between them.

### How?
The "Universal Interface" functions as a ComputerCraft peripheral and an OpenComputers2 RPCDevice. By doing so it allows inter-communication via the OpenComputers2 device bus and ComputerCraft's networking/modems.

### Why?
This project is just intended to tide me and others over for the time being until peripheral support gets better for OpenComputers2.
